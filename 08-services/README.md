Services are used to encapsulate functionality that you want to reuse in an application but that donâ€™t 
fit neatly into the Model-View-Controller pattern. Services are commonly used to implement cross-cutting 
concerns, e.g. logging, security, and networking.

Modules have two roles in AngularJS. 1 - they define the application functionality that is applied 
to the HTML elements using the ng-app directive. 2 - define functionality, such as services, directives, 
and filters, in a way that makes it easy to reuse it in different applications.
