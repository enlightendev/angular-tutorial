/**
 * Shows using  a service and $rootScope events to communicate between controllers.

 * The ZipCodes service declares a dependency on the $rootScope service and uses it
 * within the setZipCode method to call the $broadcast event. The controllers declare
 * a dependency on the ZipCodes service and call the setZipCode method rather than
 * operate directly on $rootScope. There is no change in the functionalityâ€”this
 * convention is about reducing duplication by putting code that is likely to be
 * required by different controllers in a single location.
