                 * The worker function in the directive is called the link function; it provides the
                 * means to link the directive with the HTML in the document and the data in the scope.
                 *
                 * The link function is invoked when AngularJS sets up each instance of the directive
                 * and receives three arguments: the scope for the view in which the directive has been
                 * applied, the HTML element that the directive has been applied to, and the attributes
                 * of that HTML element. The convention is to define the link function with arguments
                 * called scope, element, and attrs.
                 *
                 * GETTING DATA FROM SCOPE
                 * The first step is to get the data to display from the scope. Unlike AngularJS controllers,
                 * directives don’t declare a dependency on the $scope service; instead, they are passed the
                 * scope created by the controller that supports the view in which the directive is applied.
                 * This is important because it allows a single directive to be applied multiple times in an
                 * application, where each application may be operating on a different scope in the hierarchy
                 */

                         * exposed through the element argument that is passed to the link function.
